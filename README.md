# Swiggy-Data-Analysis-Using-MySQL

🚀 Project Title: Swiggy Data Analysis Using MySQL | Customer, Restaurant & Order Insights

Excited to share my recent SQL-based data analysis project — a deep-dive into Swiggy’s operational data using MySQL! From customer behavior and restaurant performance to delivery trends and revenue generation, this project helped me sharpen my SQL querying skills and uncover valuable insights from real-world food delivery data. 🍔📦

📊 Key Highlights of the Project:

✔ Data Cleaning & Preparation

🔹 Replaced NULL values with defaults (like placeholder emails and contact info) to ensure clean, query-ready datasets

🔹 Removed incomplete entries and ensured all key fields like customer ID, city, order date, and amount were complete and valid

✔ Customer & Order Insights

🔹 Displayed customers from specific cities like ‘Delhi’ and those who have never placed an order

🔹 Found customers who placed orders exactly on 3 different days — useful for loyalty targeting

🔹 Retrieved customers from the same city ordering from the same restaurants on different dates

✔ Restaurant & Revenue Analysis

🔹 Calculated average ratings of restaurants city-wise, and listed the top 5 highest-rated restaurants

🔹 Found total revenue generated by each restaurant and sorted them in descending order

🔹 Filtered restaurants based on review ratings in places like ‘Mumbai’

✔ Delivery & Partner Performance

🔹 Listed delivery partners who completed more than one delivery

🔹 Identified the delivery partner who worked with the most number of different customers

✔ Time-Based & Trend Analysis

🔹 Displayed orders from the last 30 days (noting that test data was older, hence limited recent results)

🔹 Grouped customer orders by date and location to understand peak activity periods

💡 What I Learned:

This project boosted my ability to write optimized JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions while dealing with real-life challenges like missing values and non-normalized data. It also gave me a clearer understanding of how food tech platforms use SQL for business insights.

📈 What’s Next:

I plan to visualize this Swiggy dataset using Power BI or Tableau to present the findings more interactively and include dashboards in my portfolio.
